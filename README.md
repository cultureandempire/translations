## How to Contribute a Translation

You need to learn a minimum of GitHub and git. Fork this repository
to your own account, then clone that to your laptop or PC. 

We work with GitHub pull requests. The workflow is:

1. Make your changes to your own repository and push the commits back
   to your repository on GitHub.

2. On your repository page in github.com, make a pull request (it is a
   simple click and confirm).

3. We'll merge your changes into the master version.

Each language sits in its own directory. To start a new language please
copy the en-us directory. I've broken the text into chapters.

If you want to add notes and comments, please add them in-line, using
this style:

    [[-- put your note here and end with -- Your name, date --]]

On a separate line, after the paragraph you're commenting on. Your notes
may be for other translators, or for readers. You can also comment and
discuss online using GitHub.

Thanks! 
-Pieter
